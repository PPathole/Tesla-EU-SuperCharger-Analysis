# Tesla-EU-SuperCharger-Analysis

Tesla Supercharger Analysis in the EU Region

Description:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of Tesla Supercharger infrastructure across the European Union (EU) region, employing a data-driven approach. The methodology comprised web scraping using Python to gather information from various sources, resulting in a structured dataset in JSON format. The acquired data underwent a meticulous cleaning process, followed by Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to enhance its usability.

The focal point of the analysis was to unveil insights into the distribution and characteristics of Tesla Supercharger stations throughout the EU. Leveraging the power of Tableau, the cleaned data was transformed into insightful visualizations. The visualizations provided a geographical overview, highlighting regions with the maximum concentration of Supercharger stations. Additionally, the analysis delved into the power distribution of the charging stalls, shedding light on the correlation between the number of stalls and the power (in kW) they offered.

Key Findings:
1. Geographical Distribution: Visual representations on the Tableau dashboard showcased the spatial distribution of Tesla Supercharger stations, pinpointing regions with the highest density.

2. Station Capacity and Power: Insights into the number of charging stalls at each station and their respective power capacities were elucidated. This information offered a nuanced understanding of the charging infrastructure's capabilities in different locations.

3. Power Distribution Analysis: The analysis further delved into the power distribution across charging stalls. This included identifying the proportion of stations offering different power levels (e.g., 150 kW, 250 kW), and providing a comprehensive view of the charging landscape.

Overall, this project not only offered a visual representation of the Tesla Supercharger landscape in the EU region but also provided actionable insights for stakeholders in the electric vehicle ecosystem, contributing to a more informed understanding of charging infrastructure in this dynamic and rapidly evolving sector.
